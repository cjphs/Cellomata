CA Script is a cellular automata simulator & editor with simple rule-set scripting using a custom notation language.

## The technical nitty-gritty

This project is divided into two parts:

- A simulation engine which enables relatively easy programming of new cellular automata
- An interpreter that makes use of custom notation to build a cellular automaton.
